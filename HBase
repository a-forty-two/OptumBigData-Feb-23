# REMEMBER-> commands are very straightforward and simple

# Our main objective-> SEARCH!!!!


list -> lists all table objects


status => gives you the cluster arrangement (master/workers)

table_help -> shows you all possible ops on the table 


scan 'current_conditions', {"LIMIT" => 2} -this command searches in the table!


slightly advanced filter using indexes to slice the data:

scan 'current_conditions', {'LIMIT' => 10, STARTROW => '15#S#1', ENDROW => '15#S#999', COLUMN => 'lane:speed'}
